## Description

The code in this repository represents the result of the landing page project from the Udacity Front Ent Web Developer nanodegree.
In this project, the task is to modify a static landing page into a dynamic & interactive landing page with JavaScript.

The following requirements are set:

- Dynamically create the navigation bar including the links according to the content in the HTML file.
- When a section is in the user's viewport, it changes to an active state including the corresponding menu link.
- Ensure a smooth scrolling behavior when clicking on the anchor links. 

Udacity's starter code that represents the static landing page to begin with was taken from this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).
